# Flight-Status-Prediction

This is a project about analyzing a flight data dataset. The dataset given by a travel agency is comprised of information about a single flight such as month, departure time, distance, etc as well as one column indicating whether the flight is canceled or not. Our task is to come up with a model that will give predictions about whether a flight is going to be canceled based on above information of the flight. Also, since the agency only sells tickets for three airlines (AA,UA, and DL), we need to give an analysis on which airline has the least risk of cancellation.
